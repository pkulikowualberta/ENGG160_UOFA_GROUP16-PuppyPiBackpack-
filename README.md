Engg160 group 16 3-D cad files 
These are all of the required files and schematics/pictues of the backpack design. 

The dxf file added of the backpack is slightly modified from all of the images and the stl file 

The dxf file for the lazer cut file is the exact same as the svg format but the svg is setup to be in 3 different colours 

ALL OF THE MEASURMENTS ARE IN MM
